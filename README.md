# Urdu Language Modeling


## Description

This aims to create and fine-tune language models for the Urdu language using the Hugging Face Transformers library. Language models are essential for various NLP tasks such as text generation, sentiment analysis, and more.

This repository contains code for:
- Tokenization using SentencePiece to create a custom tokenizer for Urdu text.
- Data preprocessing to split a dataset into training and validation sets.
- Fine-tuning pre-trained models using the Hugging Face Transformers library.

## Dataset

We are using the Urdu portion of the OPUS100 dataset, which has been preprocessed for ease of use.
