# Urdu Language Modeling


## Description

Fine-tune language models for the Urdu language using the Hugging Face Transformers library. Language models are essential for various NLP tasks such as text generation, sentiment analysis, and more.

This repository contains code for:
- Tokenization using SentencePiece to create a custom tokenizer for Urdu text.
- Data preprocessing to split a dataset into training and validation sets.
- Fine-tuning pre-trained models using the Hugging Face Transformers library.

## Dataset

We are using the Urdu portion of the OPUS100 dataset, which has been preprocessed for ease of use.

## Usage
The `UrduALBERT.ipynb` notebook provides a step-by-step guide to tokenizing Urdu text and fine-tuning pre-trained models.
Use the provided scripts to preprocess data, tokenize text, and fine-tune models.

## Acknowledgments

- The Hugging Face Transformers library for providing powerful tools for natural language processing.
- The creators of the OPUS100 dataset for making multilingual data available.
